 * _I_ am the software author - JohannesMP on Github.
 * _You_ are the user of this software. You might be a _we_, and that's OK!
 *
 * This is free, open source software. I will never charge you to use,
 * license, or obtain this software. Doing so would make me a jerk.
 *
 * You may use the content of this project (and by "project" I mean the immediate 
 * directory containing this license, and all its files) for whatever you want. 
 * Personal use, Educational use, Corporate use, and all other uses are OK!
 *
 * I offer no warranty on anything in this project, and you are using it at
 * your own risk, of your own free will. I've tried my best to ensure that 
 * there are no gaping security holes where using this software might erase
 * your hard drive or give you constipation, but it might happen. I'm sorry. 
 * However, I warned you, so you can't sue me. Suing people over free 
 * software would make you a jerk.
 *
 * If you find bugs, it would be nice if you let me know so I can fix them.
 * You don't have to, but it would be appreciated.
 *
 * Speaking of bugs, I am not obligated to fix anything, nor am I obligated 
 * to add any features for you, though I will consider your suggestions. 
 * Feeling entitled about free software would make you a jerk.
 *
 * If you add a new feature or fix a bug, it would be nice if you contributed 
 * it back to the project, but you don't have to. The repository/site you 
 * obtained this software from should contain a way for you to contact me. 
 * Contributing to open source makes you awesome!
 *
 * If you use this software, you may remove this license, and don't have to
 * give me any credit, but it would be great if you did.
 *
 * Don't be a jerk. Enjoy your free software! :)
