Guide for navigating issues in USim that can block work flow in using the SynthDet Sample Project.

## USim can’t find my project
If USim can’t find your execution id within the active project you may need to activate the Sample Project in order to find your execution id. This mainly applies if you have already been using Unity Simulation with other project 

You might see an error message like this:
usim summarize run-execution Ojbm1n0
{"message":"Could not find project=595c36c6-a73d-4dfd-bd8e-d68f1f5f3084, executionId=Ojbm1n0"}
