SynthDet Statistics Jupyter Notebook
====================================

This example notebook demonstrates how to use the [Dataset Insights](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/datasetinsights) Python package to load and analyze synthetic datasets generated with the SynthDet project, which utilizes the Unity [Perception package](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.perception). This notebook includes statistics and visualizations for Labelers (ground-truth generators) included in the Perception package, as well as additional metrics that are specific to SynthDet.

## Workflow

* If you do not have Conda installed on your computer, install Conda. We recommend [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

* Once Conda is installed: 
  * On Mac OS, open a new terminal window.
  * On Windows, you will need to open either Anaconda Prompt or Anaconda Powershell Prompt. These can be found in the Start menu.

* Create a virtual environment named `synthdet_env` using Conda, and activate it:

```bash
conda create -n synthdet_env python=3.8
conda activate synthdet_env
```

* Install datasetinsights package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install datasetinsights
```

* Navigate to the folder where the `SynthDet_Statistics.ipynb` notebook file is located.
  
* You now can open the notebook using the command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

* Once you are in the notebook. Make sure that the kernel is set to `synthdet_env`. (Kernel -> Change kernel)
  * The notebook may ask you to set this environment when you first open it.

* You will now see a file explorer in Jupyter:

* Click `SynthDet_Statistics.ipynb` to open the notebook.

* Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code cells and visualize statistics for your SynthDet dataset.
