# Getting Started with USim
In order to run on Unity Simulation, you need an account in the Unity Simulation Beta program. Please see this [sign-up](https://unity.com/products/simulation) page to get started on Unity Simulation Beta. Simulations can be run on the local machine without Unity Simulation but will execute at much higher scale on Unity Simulation.
