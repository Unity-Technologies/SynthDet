# Unity SynthDet 
In this current deliverable, the primary elements that we are including are the Perception SDK, annotation data,using Thea for creating trained data models, and execution of simulations on the local machine or Unity Simulation platform.

This release will help with walking through the steps of creating synthetic datasets using an example project. 

## Features
* Unity SynthDet project that includes all the code and assets for reproducing the synthetic dataset at scale in Unity Simulation
* Using Unity Simulation to run and reproduce a synthetic dataset
* Dokcer image containing the tool called Thea which is python based toolset for creating dataset insight models 
* Perception SDK
