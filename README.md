# SynthDet: An end-to-end object detection pipeline using synthetic data  
[![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-green.svg)](LICENSE.md)
## Overview 
SynthDet is an open source project that demonstrates an end-to-end object detection pipeline using synthetic image data. The project includes all the code and assets for generating a synthetic dataset in Unity. Using recent [research](#Citation), SynthDet utilizes Unity Perception package to generate highly randomized images of 64 common grocery products (example: cereal boxes and candy) and export them along with appropriate labels and annotations (2D bounding boxes). The synthetic dataset generated can then be used to train a deep learning based object detection model.
This project is geared towards ML practitioners and enthusiasts who are actively exploring synthetic data or just looking to get started. 

### [Getting started with SynthDet](docs/Readme.md)

## Contents 
* SynthDet - Unity Perception sample project
* 3D Assets - High quality models of 64 commonly found grocery products
* Unity Perception package
* Unity Dataset Insights Python package

## Inspiration
SynthDet was inspired by the following research paper from Google Cloud AI:  

Hinterstoisser, S., Pauly, O., Heibel, H., Marek, M., & Bokeloh, M. (2019). [*An Annotation Saved is an Annotation Earned: Using Fully Synthetic Training for Object Instance Detection.* ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09967.pdf)

## Support
